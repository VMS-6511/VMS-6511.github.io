Our work uncovering and formalizing spurious correlations originating from syntactic shortcuts in LLMs, Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntatic-Domain Shortcuts in Language Models, was awarded a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025! This work provides a new perspective on different forms of memorization and uncovers a new type of jailbreak in LLMs.
