I'll be a Visiting Student Researcher at Stanford with [Dr. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/) from February to June 2026. Afterwards, I'll be interning at Meta's Superintelligence Labs working on privacy and security research for AI agents under [Dr. Kamalika Chaudhuri's](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/) team from June to August 2026.
