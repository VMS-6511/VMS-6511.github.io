I'm excited to announce that I've accepted an offer to join the PhD program starting Fall 2021 at MIT EECS where I will be affiliated with CSAIL, LIDS, and IMES. I will be co-advised by [Dr. Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). I will continue my research focusing on the methodological and theoretical foundations of machine learning, optimization, sampling, differential privacy, and algorithmic fairness.
