I'm a Masters student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) & [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) advised by [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), [Dr. Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/), [Dr. Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/), and [Dr. Anna Goldenberg](http://goldenberglab.ca/). My research focuses on fundamental questions of trustworthy machine learning and responsible computing. Currently, I focus on the theory and applications of **differential privacy**, **algorithmic fairness**, and **cryptography** to machine learning and healthcare. I use techniques from math, statistics, optimization, economics, and theoretical computer science (i.e. learning theory and computational complexity) to conduct this research.

### Current Projects
1. Strongly Rayleigh Measures for Differentially Private Fair Learning
2. Fair Personalization in Machine Learning for Healthcare
3. Privacy Amplification for Data-Dependent Subsampling
4. Multi-label Private and Secure Model-Agnostic Collaborative Learning
