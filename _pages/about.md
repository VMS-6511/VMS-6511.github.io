 I am a third year PhD student at MIT EECS affiliated with CSAIL, LIDS, and IMES where I am advised by [Dr. Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, statistical inference, and society. I am interested in building theoretically principled algorithms to address social concerns about the use of machine learning. Currently, I'm thinking about issues surrounding copyright and attribution, auditing and the fairness of algorithmic decision making.  Additionally, I work on developing statistical tools to help address health inequities in maternal health. 
 
 Previously, I worked on differentially private machine learning, machine unlearning, and applications to organ procurement processes. I completed my Masters in May 2021 at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) & [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) advised by [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), [Dr. Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/), [Dr. Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/), and [Dr. Anna Goldenberg](http://goldenberglab.ca/). My thesis was focused on differential privacy and algorithmic fairness in machine learning for healthcare.
