 I am an incoming PhD student at MIT EECS affiliated with CSAIL, LIDS, and IMES where I will be advised by [Dr. Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). My research focuses on fundamental questions of trustworthy machine learning. Currently, I focus on the theory and practice of **differential privacy** and **algorithmic fairness** in machine learning. I am also interested in **optimization** and **learning theory**. I recently completed a research internship at Google Research working with [Dr. Om Thakkar](http://www.omthakkar.com/) and [Swaroop Ramaswamy](https://research.google/people/106336/) on differentially private federated learning. 
 
 I completed my Masters in May 2021 at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) & [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) advised by [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), [Dr. Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/), [Dr. Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/), and [Dr. Anna Goldenberg](http://goldenberglab.ca/). My thesis was focused on differential privacy and algorithmic fairness in machine learning for healthcare.

### Current Projects
1. Differential Privacy and Distributional Robustness
2. Fair Personalization in Machine Learning for Healthcare
3. Adaptive Gradient Boosting Machines
