 I am a fifth year PhD student at MIT EECS where I am advised by [Dr. Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). I also collaborate frequently with [Dr. Dylan Hadfield-Menell](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/). I'm supported through a fellowship from [Bridgewater Associates and AIA Lab](https://www.bridgewater.com/) led by [Dr. Jas Sekhon](https://statistics.yale.edu/people/jas-sekhon) where I also conduct research part-time. 
 
 Broadly, I'm interested in the privacy, security, and safety of machine learning. Throughout my Masters and PhD, I've worked on many topics in these areas including differential privacy, auditing, algorithmic fairness, and unlearning. 
 
 **These days, the goal of my research is to prevent the misuse of foundation models, especially when it comes to open-sourcing these models.** I work on questions related to uncovering risks of open-weight models, applying intepretability to understand these risks, and building safeguards to address these risks. 

 My research on privacy, security, and safety has been recognized with spotlight, oral, and best paper awards at NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and FAccT. These awards are listed below:

 - ICML 2022 Spotlight
 - ICML 2023 Oral
 - ICLR 2024 Oral
 - FAccT 2024 Best Paper Award
 - NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight
