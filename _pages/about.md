I'm a Research Intern at Google Research working with [Dr. Om Thakkar](http://www.omthakkar.com/) on differentially private federated learning. I just completed my Masters in May 2021 at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) & [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) advised by [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), [Dr. Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/), [Dr. Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/), and [Dr. Anna Goldenberg](http://goldenberglab.ca/). My research focuses on fundamental questions of trustworthy machine learning. Currently, I focus on the theory and applications of **differential privacy** and **algorithmic fairness** to machine learning and healthcare. I'll be starting my PhD in Fall 2021 at MIT EECS affiliated with CSAIL, LIDS, and IMES where I'll continue my research in these areas with [Dr. Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/).

### Current Projects
1. Differentially Privacy, Fairness, and Distributional Robustness in Optimization
2. Fair Personalization in Machine Learning
