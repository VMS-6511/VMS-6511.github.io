 I am a fifth year PhD student at MIT EECS where I am advised by [Dr. Ashia Wilson](https://www.ashiawilson.com/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). I also collaborate frequently with [Dr. Dylan Hadfield-Menell](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/). I'm supported through a fellowship from [Bridgewater Associates and AIA Lab](https://www.bridgewater.com/) led by [Dr. Jas Sekhon](https://statistics.yale.edu/people/jas-sekhon) where I also conduct research part-time. 
 
 Broadly, I'm interested in the privacy, security, and safety of machine learning. I've worked on many topics in these areas including differential privacy, auditing, algorithmic fairness, and unlearning. 
 
 **These days, the focus of my research is to address open-weight model safety and security.** This includes questions on safety pretraining, unlearning, robustness to tampering attacks, and intepretability. Simultaneously, I spend sometime thinking about security issues for closed-models such as jailbreaking and securing finetuning APIs. 

 My research advancing the privacy, security and safety of machine learning has received awards at NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and FAccT:

 - ICML 2022 Spotlight
 - ICML 2023 Oral
 - ICLR 2024 Oral
 - FAccT 2024 Best Paper Award
 - NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight
